# ðŸš€ KiroCLI Phase 4 Demo Guide

## Quick Demo of New Features

### 1. First-Time User Experience

```bash
# Remove welcome file to simulate first-time user
rm -f ~/.kirocli/.welcome-shown

# Run KiroCLI to see getting started tutorial
kirocli
```

**What you'll see:**
- 6-step interactive tutorial
- Platform detection (Linux x64)
- Feature overview with beautiful terminal UI
- API key setup guidance
- Navigation instructions

### 2. AI Command Understanding

```bash
# Start chat mode
kirocli chat

# Try these natural language commands:
```

**Test Commands:**
1. `"delete all .log files"` â†’ Should suggest `find . -name '*.log' -type f -delete`
2. `"show git status"` â†’ Should suggest `git status`
3. `"list files in current directory"` â†’ Should suggest `ls -la`
4. `"create a directory called test"` â†’ Should suggest `mkdir test`
5. `"find all JavaScript files"` â†’ Should suggest `find . -name '*.js'`

**Expected Flow:**
1. Type natural language request
2. AI interprets and suggests specific command
3. Shows safety level (safe/caution/dangerous)
4. Provides explanation
5. Ask for confirmation (yes/no)
6. Execute and show results

### 3. Enhanced Main Menu

```bash
# Run main menu
kirocli
```

**Features:**
- Beautiful terminal UI with borders
- Clear navigation instructions
- Direct access to all features
