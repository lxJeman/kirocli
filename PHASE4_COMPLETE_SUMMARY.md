   - Validates and sanitizes all commands
   - Blocks dangerous operations automatically
   - Provides detailed safety warnings
   - Suggests safer alternatives

3. **Interactive Command Flow:**
   - Preview commands before execution
   - Edit commands before running
   - Real-time execution progress
   - Comprehensive error recovery

4. **Professional User Experience:**
